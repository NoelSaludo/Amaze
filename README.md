|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Utilizes Pathfinding Algorithms | Implement and demonstrate algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm, Depth First Search (DFS), and Breadth First Search (BFS). |
| Creates and Loads Mazes     | Enable users to create, load, and interact with predefined maze representations.                  |
| Determines Shortest Path    | Educate users on finding the shortest path through visualization and comparison of different pathfinding techniques.|

## 🔬 Scope and Limitations

- **Scope✅**: The project covers the development of a generic map representation and the implementation of pathfinding algorithms.
- **Limitations❌**: The simulation is limited to predefined maps and will not account for real-time changes in the environment.

## 👀 Features

## 🧠 Algorithm Explanation

- **Dijkstra Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
- **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
