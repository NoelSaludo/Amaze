# MAZE SOLVER SIMULATION

## 🎯 Introduction 
This project outlines the development of a C++ based simulation tool for maze pathfinding. The simulation enables users to learn how basic pathfinding works using graphs. This project aims to educate users on basic graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms, providing a hands-on learning experience.

|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Utilizes Pathfinding Algorithms | Implement and demonstrate algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm, Depth First Search (DFS), and Breadth First Search (BFS). |
| Creates and Loads Mazes     | Enable users to create, load, and interact with predefined maze representations.                  |
| Determines Shortest Path    | Educate users on finding the shortest path through visualization and comparison of different pathfinding techniques.|

## 🔬 Scope and Limitations

- **Scope**: The project covers the development of a generic map representation and the implementation of pathfinding algorithms.
- **Limitations**: The simulation is limited to predefined maps and will not account for real-time changes in the environment.

## 👀 Features

- **Map Representation**: A generic grid or graph representation of a maze.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Implementation of efficient pathfinding algorithms to calculate optimal routes.
- **Visualization**: Clear and visually appealing display of the calculated path.
- **User Input Handling**: Smooth user interaction for selecting mazes and algorithms, with robust error handling.
- Desired output:

## 🧠 Algorithm Explanation

- **Dijkstra Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
- **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
